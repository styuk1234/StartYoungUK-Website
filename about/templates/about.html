            <p>A group of likeminded individuals came together in 2020, in order to help and support local schools in East London. It is a sad reality of our times, that many areas in the UK are poverty stricken, with many children and young adults going without the basics. Although there are a number of excellent charities gifting during the Christmas Season, the schools we had contact with requested clothes and food, rather than toys. Children were coming to school with socks on their hands instead of gloves, and some with no under garments. This was a huge eye opener for us.</p>
            <p>The group started with a Christmas Gifting Initiative the same year and we were able to give over 400 parcels and food hampers. The care packages included underwear, socks, hats, gloves & scarves. Start Young UK was born.</p>
            <p>The charity felt that in order to support these children further, we should now expand the offer to include their families. All of the families were struggling financially and the impact of COVID-19, had only made their situations worse. Our aim was to ensure those families who were disadvantaged and living in poverty, were prioritised. It was apparent that this was an even bigger problem than we had initially anticipated and although the gifts were a help, these families needed long term assistance and solutions needed to be found</p>
